3. Finish the installation

### Usage



### Settings

Go to *Site Administration* -> *Reports* -> *Time Reports*. Descriptions for the settings are as follows :

#### tool_time_report/targets

Defines the targets from the `logstore_standard_log` table that are wanted in the report.
All the different kind of targets are retrived by the locallib `get_targets` function.

#### tool_time_report/idletime

Defines the time span after which the difference in time between 2 logs is considered as inactivity.

#### tool_time_report/borrowedtime

Defines the amount of time counted in the report that the user has after being considered inactive.

Without this, the last action of viewing a course module performed by a user (e.g. a PDF file) before his inactivity would not generate additional connection time for one day. For the benefit of the doubt, we grant a specific amount of time.

### Grunt

`amd/build/*.js` and `styles.css` files are generated by Grunt tasks.

Run `grunt watch`, `grunt amd` or `grunt sass` from the root directory of Moodle to modify the files.
