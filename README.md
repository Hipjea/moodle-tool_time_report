## Usage

Admins can access the reports through the user's profile (e.g. `/user/profile.php?id=2`), under the **reports category**.

The interface allow the creationg of CSV files listing 

The plugin uses a cron task job to generate the reports. It is not needed to stay on the page while the report is generating. 

A notification is sent to the requestor when the report is ready to be downloaded.

The name of the files are created according the following scheme :
`report__firstname_lastname__mm-yyyy_mm-yyyy.csv`

`mm-yyyy_mm-yyyy` being the selected starting date followed by the ending date.

```


## Settings

Go to *Site Administration* -> *Reports* -> *Time Reports*. Descriptions for the settings are as follows :

#### tool_time_report/targets

Defines the targets from the `logstore_standard_log` table that are wanted in the report.
All the different kind of targets are retrived by the locallib `get_targets` function.

#### tool_time_report/idletime

Defines the time span after which the difference in time between 2 logs is considered as inactivity.

#### tool_time_report/borrowedtime

Defines the amount of time counted in the report that the user has after being considered inactive.

Without this, the last action of viewing a course module performed by a user (e.g. a PDF file) before his inactivity would not generate additional connection time for one day. For the benefit of the doubt, we grant a specific amount of time.


## Development

`amd/build/*.js` and `styles.css` files are generated by Grunt tasks.

Run `grunt watch`, `grunt amd` or `grunt sass` from the root directory of Moodle to modify the files.
